# Chocolate-Box-Simulator
A program that simulates picking from a box of chocolates

## Description

This is a silly little console game that simulates the experience of picking a piece of chocolate out of a chocolate box and not being sure what you'll get! The program uses C++ and demonstrates my ability to utilize OOP concepts like pointers, inheritence, virtual functions, and multi-dimensional dynamic arrays

## Usage

Requires a linux terminal. Includes a main.cpp file. 

first compile the main file

```bash
$ g++ main.cpp
```

then run the object file that has been created along with a seed value

```bash
$ ./a.out 42
```

Any seed value may be used. If user does not provide a seed value, an error message will pop up and program will terminate.
